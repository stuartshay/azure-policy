# Final Test Configuration and Lessons Learned

## Final State
- All basic and workspace-level tests pass with no errors.
- Advanced function tests that depend on Service Bus are now skipped if the ServiceBusConnectionString is not set, preventing spurious failures in CI and local runs without credentials.
- All Service Bus-dependent tests in `functions/advanced/tests/test_advanced_function_app.py` are robustly isolated from the environment.
- Test discovery and execution is reliable for all function folders in VS Code Test Explorer.

## What Was Fixed
- Added missing `functions/__init__.py` for import path resolution.
- Installed `pytest` in all per-function venvs.
- Fixed fixture naming and import order in `tests/conftest.py`.
- Added a class-level skip for Service Bus-dependent tests in advanced function tests, so they are skipped if the connection string is not set.
- Cleaned up blank lines and import order for PEP8 compliance.

## Best Practices for Future Maintenance
- Always use absolute imports in test files for robust discovery.
- Each function folder should have its own `.vscode/settings.json` and venv for test isolation.
- For tests that require cloud credentials or external services, use mocking or conditional skipping to ensure tests do not fail in CI or local environments without those credentials.
- Keep all shared fixtures in a single `conftest.py` at the workspace root, and avoid duplicate definitions.
- After adding new function folders, ensure test discovery is configured and run all tests to verify isolation and robustness.

## Context7 Research
- Not yet used for this project, but recommended for future third-party library integration or best practices.

## Lessons Learned
- Consistent test isolation and robust mocking/skipping are critical for maintainable, reliable test suites in modular Azure Functions projects.
- Test failures due to missing credentials or external dependencies can be avoided with proper use of `unittest.skipUnless` or `pytest.skip`.
